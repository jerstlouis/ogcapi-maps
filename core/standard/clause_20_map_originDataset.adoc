== Requirements Class "Dataset Map"

=== Overview

[[dataset-maps-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_dataset-map.adoc[]

The Maps API core requirements class defines how to retrieve a map from a resource but does not detail which resources can be "mapped". The Dataset Map requirements class defines how to retrieve a map resource from the dataset represented by the service. In other words, it provides the path to retrieve a map resource from the dataset behind the API endpoint. This is achieved by adding the map path to the root (a.k.a. the landing page) of the service.

=== General

The Dataset Map describes how to serve maps for a dataset provided as Web API instance implementing  _OGC API - Common - Part 1_ requirement classes or https://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0] as an alternative.

=== Dataset API landing page

The landing page provides links to start exploring the resources offered by the API endpoint. The landing page mainly consists of a list of links to root resources. The Maps API Standard extension specifies a new link in the landing page for getting a dataset map.

==== Response

The root path of an OGC API offering access to geospatial data represents a dataset that will be exposed in different ways by the API.

Sub-resources can be added to the root path of an OGC API endpoint to complement it by offering new endpoints indirectly giving access to the complemented dataset. Other OGC API Standards will define this mechanism. An example is OGC API - Styles which defines how to complement a geospatial resource by adding a style to it. The new resources is an overlap of the dataset and the resource.

include::requirements/dataset-map/REQ_landingpage.adoc[]

In the landing page, in JSON format, the links follow the link schema defined in the OGC API - Common or in the OGC API - Features v1 Standards. Below you can find an example fragment of the response to an OGC API - Maps landing page showing the link to the dataset map.

=== Dataset maps

==== Map path

include::requirements/dataset-map/REQ_operation.adoc[]

The operation request does not define extra parameters. Servers can advertise the requirements class https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-tiles-1/1.0/req/collections-selection to add a `collections` parameter that can be used to include only parts of the dataset in the map representation.

==== Response
A successful GET response is described in the core class (https://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-maps-1/1.0/conf/core).

A successful response is a map resource that represents the entire dataset. In a Web API providing access to a complex dataset comprised of several geospatial data resources, there are reasons for being selective in the amount of information included. This can be achieved by applying a manual filter described in the <<rc_collections-selection>> or as an automatic decision by the server side.
