identifier:: /req/collection-map/desc-crs
part:: The `crs` property in the collection object of a geospatial collection SHALL contain URI or safe CURIEs for the list of CRSs supported by the server for that collection.
part:: If the collection is available more efficiently (e.g., if it is stored in the server in that CRS) using a particular CRS (the native CRS, also _called storage CRS_) that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the collection object of a geospatial collection SHALL be the URI or the safe CURIE for that CRS.
part:: If a `storageCrs` property is used and that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, an overall bounding box (and optional inner bounding boxes for sparse data) SHALL be provided in a `storageCrsBbox` property within the `spatial` dimension of the `extent` following the same schema as the CRS84 `bbox`.
