identifier:: /req/spatial-subsetting/subset-definition
part:: The implementation SHALL support a `subset` parameter conforming to the following Augmented Backus Naur Form (ABNF) fragment:
+
[source,ABNF]
----
  SubsetSpec:       "subset"=axisName(intervalOrSingle)
  axisName:         {text}
  intervalOrSingle: interval \| single
  interval:         low : high
  low:              single \| *
  high:             single \| *
  single:            {number} \| "{text}"

  Where:
     \" = double quote = ASCII code 0x42,
     {number} is an integer or floating-point number, and
     {text} is some general ASCII text (such as a time and date notation in ISO 8601).
----
part:: Axis names `Lat` and `Lon` SHALL be supported for geographic CRS and `E` and `N` for projected CRS, which are to be interpreted as the best matching spatial axis in the CRS definition.
part:: If a third spatial dimension is supported (if the resource's spatial extent bounding box is three dimensional), the implementation SHALL also support a `h` dimension. This is the elevation above the ellipsoid in EPSG:4979 or CRS84h for geographic CRS and `z` for projected CRS, which are to be interpreted as the vertical axis in the CRS definition.
part:: A 400 error status code SHALL be returned if an axis name in the subset parameter value does not correspond to one of the axes of the subsetting CRS ^2^.
part:: If the _interval_ values fall entirely outside the range of valid values defined for the identified axis, a 204 or 404 status code SHALL be returned.
part:: For a CRS where an axis can wrap around, such as subsetting across the dateline (anti-meridian) in a geographic CRS, a _low_ value greater than _high_ SHALL be supported to indicate an extent crossing that wrapping point.
part:: Coordinates SHALL be interpreted as values for the named axis of the CRS specified in the `subset-crs` parameter value or in https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 (https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84h for vertical dimension) if the `subset-crs` parameter is missing.
part:: If the `subset` parameter including any of the dimensions corresponding to those of the map bounding box is used with a `bbox` and/or `center` parameter, the server SHALL return a 400 client error.
part:: Multiple `subset` parameters SHALL be interpreted, as if all dimension subsetting values were provided in a single `subset` parameter (comma separated)^1^.
+
^1^ Example: `subset=Lat(-90:90)&subset=Lon(-180:180)` is equivalent to `subset=Lat(-90:90),Lon(-180:180)`
+
^2^ Note that this is only valid of the spatial dimensions. The 'additional' dimensions relay on the names of the extent of the collection.

NOTE: A subset parameter for https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 will read as subset=Lon(left_lon:right_lon),Lat(lower_lat:upper_lat).

NOTE: When the _interval_ values fall partially outside of the range of valid values defined by the CRS for the identified axis, the service is expected to return the non-empty portion of the resource resulting from the subset.

NOTE: For the operation of returning a map, there normally is no value in preserving dimensionality, therefore a _slicing_ operation (using the _point_ notation) is usually equivalent to
a _trimming_ operation (using the _interval_ notation) when the low and high bounds of an interval are the same. Therefore, use of the point notation is encouraged in these cases.
