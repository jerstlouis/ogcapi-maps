[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/dataset-map/desc-crs
part:: The `crs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL contain a URI or a safe CURIE for the list of CRSs supported by the dataset as a whole.
part:: If the dataset is available more efficiently using a particular CRS that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, a `storageCrs` property in the landing page of a dataset SHALL have the URI or the safe CURIE for that CRS as a value. For example, it may be more efficient to retrieve a map in the same CRS used to store the data. Note that the native CRS is also called the _storage CRS_.
part:: If a `storageCrs` property is used and that is not https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84, an overall bounding box (and optional inner bounding boxes for sparse data) SHALL be provided in a `storageCrsBbox` property within the `spatial` dimension of the `extent` following the same schema as the CRS84 `bbox`.
